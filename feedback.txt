1) I'm not sure what your workflow plan is, but it would have been nicer to just edit the README files with the answers.

2) I think the bottom layer directory should just be the file with the question that can be edited.
   For code questions but the question/task in comments in the header maybe.
    i.e. basic
            -> embedded
                -> shift_questions.txt
                -> soc_audio_questions.txt

3) I have 2 more I haven't done I believe that I will probably finish before meeting you on Thursday.
