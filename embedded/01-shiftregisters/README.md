Explain how spi, i2c and serial are all at their core shift registers.

How are these three lowlevel bit based protocols the same and different?

Why does spi use chip selects but i2c and serial do not?

How are different devices on the same i2c bus differentiated?

How many bytes must be shifted out of a spi master to get one byte back from 
a spi slave.
