Some Basic Development Tasks

Each skill subdirectory contains numbered question subdirectories.
Each sub-sub-directory has a README.md file containing a question or task.

## Steps

 * Clone this repo and add your answers to the answer.txt file in each
sub-subdirectory.
 * Optionally add any feedback you have to the feedback.txt file.
 * Commit your changes and answers and send a pull request to submit them.

Use any resource you like to help you answer the questions.
Some questions may have more than one answer.
