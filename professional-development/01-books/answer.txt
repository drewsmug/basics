>> What is the last technical book you bought and why did you buy it?

I recently bought the famous "Introduction to Algorithms" book by the 4 authors collectively known as CLRS.
I bought it to gain a much deeper understanding of the course matertial and to
help me on both the practice problems I do online and any potential future interviews.

>> What are your go to publishers when you are looking for technical book?

I generally search hard to find which book people consider to be the "Bible" in that area.
I don't focus much on the publisher but I have plenty of O'Reilly books as those have been proven to have a good standard.

>>If you could learn a new programming language what would it be?

If I had to choose a brand new language I guess it would be C# to allow me to do iOS app development for fun.
In reality I am looking to do a refresher on Python or C++ (or maybe Java) to get more comfortable with an OOP language.

>> When is the last time you bought a programming language book that was not for your job
>> (you did it just for fun)?

I buy a lot of tech books that, though not specifically for work, are usually not entirely unrelated.
In the same Amazon order I purchased the following two books for education and entertainment purposes;
1) Programming Android
2) Linux Device Drivers
