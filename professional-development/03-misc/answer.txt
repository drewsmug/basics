>> What do you do to keep your skills uptodate?

I like to do puzzles from sites like "projecteuler.net", "codechef.com", and "topcoder.com".
I regularly have tech projects I like to work on.
    - Made my own remote controlled thermastat.
    - Made a event finding website to learn Python and Amazon's Web Services.
Current projects on my todo list are

What job to you want to be doing in 1, 2, 5 and 10 years?

1 year: Vivint
2 years: Vivint
5 years: Vivint
10 years: Vivint

:)

The short answer is I want to keep doing as much development as I can for at least the next 5 years.
Specifically I am looking to switch into a new and exciting area of technology, where I can
have the opportunity to watch and be a part of it's long-term growth (i.e. home automation).

In 10 years I know I'll still want to be technical. I like solving and designing
big problems. I am interested in helping solve industry level problems in the home automation space
(and in whatever space develops and evolves out of it). I'd like to use the previous years
to help mold myself into an industry expert that can help drive and shape the future.

>> If you didn't need to work for a living what would you do with your time?

I’ve always fantasized about being a successful entrepreneur. I’d probably keep trying to start a
business until I was either successful or I reached a point where I needed to work for a living again.
I’ve learned it’s been good for my psyche when I am building, creating and progressing towards some goal.

My other dream has always been to buy a sailboat and sail around the world.
