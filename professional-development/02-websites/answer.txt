>> What websites do you visit regularly to help you keep up to date on topics related to embedded linux or other related topics?

www.reddit.com/r/programming
www.reddit.com/r/linux
and other reddit subthreads.

I also like to read "slashdot.org"

I use to follow the Linux Kernel mailing list at lkml.org but not as much now that I have been working more on an RTOS.
